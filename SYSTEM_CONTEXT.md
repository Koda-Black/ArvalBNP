A: Fixed monthly costs, no depreciation risk, VAT benefits for businesses, hassle-free maintenance options, and access to brand new vehicles without large capital outlay.

**Q: Are there any risks with Contract Hire?**
A: The main considerations are mileage limits (excess mileage charges apply) and fair wear and tear standards at vehicle return. We'll explain all terms clearly before you sign.

**Q: Is vehicle leasing just for larger companies?**
A: Not at all! We offer solutions for businesses of all sizes, from 1-10 vehicles right up to large fleets. We also offer personal leasing for individuals.

**Q: Can I purchase my vehicle at the end of the contract?**

### During Your Contract

**Q: Is road fund licence (tax) included?**
A: Yes, Road Fund Licence is typically included in your lease agreement.

**Q: Can I take my lease car abroad?**
A: Yes, you can take your vehicle abroad. We'll provide the necessary documentation including VE103 form for travel within Europe.

A: Yes, personalised number plates can be used on lease vehicles. Contact us to discuss the process.

**Q: When will I start paying for my vehicle?**
A: Payments typically begin from the date of vehicle delivery or registration, depending on your agreement terms.

### Maintenance & Servicing

**Q: What's covered within guaranteed maintenance?**
A: Our Maintenance Package typically covers scheduled servicing, MOT testing, tyres, batteries, exhausts, brakes, and general repairs due to wear and tear.

A: Call our 24/7 roadside assistance number immediately. Keep safe, and our team will arrange recovery and a replacement vehicle if needed.

### Electric Vehicles (EVs)

**Q: What is the range of an EV?**
A: Modern EVs typically offer 200-350 miles on a full charge, though this varies by model and driving conditions.

**Q: What factors affect the real-life range?**
A: Weather (cold reduces range), driving style, speed, use of heating/AC, terrain, and cargo weight all affect range.

**Q: How long does it take to charge an EV?**
A: It varies: Home charging (7kW) takes 6-12 hours. Rapid chargers (50kW+) can achieve 80% in 30-60 minutes.

**Q: Why do rapid charge times only go to 80%?**
A: Charging slows after 80% to protect battery longevity. It's more efficient to charge to 80% and continue your journey.

**Q: How much does it cost to charge an EV at home?**
A: Based on average electricity rates, a full charge costs approximately £10-15, significantly less than a tank of petrol.

**Q: How much does it cost to run an EV?**
A: EVs are significantly cheaper to run than petrol/diesel. Lower fuel costs, reduced maintenance (no oil changes), and tax benefits make them very economical.

**Q: What happens if I run out of electricity or breakdown?**
A: Our 24/7 roadside assistance covers EVs. We can arrange charging, towing to a charge point, or recovery as needed.

**Q: How long do EV batteries last?**
A: Modern EV batteries are designed to last 8-15 years. Manufacturers typically warranty batteries for 8 years or 100,000 miles.

**Q: Can I tow a caravan or trailer with an EV?**
A: Some EVs have towing capability. Check the specific vehicle specifications, as this varies by model.

### End of Contract

**Q: What is the process for returning the vehicle?**
A: We'll arrange collection from your chosen address. Before return, ensure the vehicle is clean and all personal items are removed.

**Q: If my car is damaged, do I have to repair it before collection?**
A: Minor fair wear and tear is acceptable. Significant damage may incur charges. We'll conduct an inspection at collection.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my contracted mileage?**
A: Excess mileage charges apply at a per-mile rate specified in your contract. Contact us if you anticipate exceeding your allowance - we can often adjust mid-contract.

**Q: When do I stop paying for a vehicle at end of contract?**
A: Payments continue until the official end date of your agreement, not when the vehicle is collected.

### Salary Sacrifice

**Q: What is Salary Sacrifice?**
A: Salary Sacrifice (Ignition by Arval) lets employees lease a new car through their employer, with payments taken from gross salary, providing tax and NI savings.

**Q: Who can benefit from Salary Sacrifice?**
A: Both employers (reduced NI contributions) and employees (tax-efficient car access) benefit from salary sacrifice schemes.
